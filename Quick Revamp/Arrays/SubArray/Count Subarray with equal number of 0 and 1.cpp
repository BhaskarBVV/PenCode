//  Key Idea
// Treat 0 as -1 when calculating sum (but don't actually change the array).
// This way, a subarray with equal number of 0s and 1s will have a net sum of 0.
// Use a prefix sum + hashmap (called frequency_of_sum) to count how many times each sum has occurred.
// If a prefix sum repeats, it means the subarray between those two points has a sum of 0 â†’ equal number of 0s and 1s.
